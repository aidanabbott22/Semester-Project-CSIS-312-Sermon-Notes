An open-source application built from a refactored Liberty University CSIS 312 assignment, originally designed to generate PDFs from user input.
This project has since evolved into a full-fledged sermon notes tool for those who want to digitally store and print their weekly messages.

Project Overview
Originally a simple PDF generator built as part of a class assignment, this project has been reimagined by two Liberty University students into an open-source sermon notes application.
We realized the potential in our original project and wanted to expand its usefulness—especially for pastors, Bible study leaders, and anyone who wants to prepare sermon or devotional notes in a clean, simple way and export them as a PDF for storage or printing.

Current Features:
Input sermon notes via a simple text interface
Export sermon notes as a downloadable PDF

To/Do
Add cover page to the PDF
Add/Improve Text Formating 
Redesign the UI
Fix the PDF Generation Fucntions
Improve code documentation for contributors
Add the ability to append notes to an existing PDF

Why This Matters
While many people still love physical notes, digital tools are becoming more essential. Our goal is to bridge both worlds by giving users the flexibility to write, store, and print their sermon notes—all in a digital place.
